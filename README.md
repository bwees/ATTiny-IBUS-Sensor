# ATTiny-IBUS-Sensor

Proof of concept for using an ATTiny85 as a Ibus sensor with Flysky protocols. This project uses PlatformIO to override processor speed.

Using library from https://github.com/Hrastovc/iBUStelemetry. This library seems to work unlike the [predecessor](https://github.com/adis1313/iBUSTelemetry-Arduino)

WARNING: I have noticed flakiness in flight with my prototype. Not sure if its a code issue or wiring issue.
